# 📄 Project Statement – Password Generator (Python)

## 🔍 Problem Statement
In today’s digital world, users often struggle to create strong and secure passwords.  
Weak or predictable passwords increase the risk of unauthorized access, data breaches, and cyberattacks.  
There is a need for a simple tool that can automatically generate secure, random passwords while allowing users to customize password rules based on their preferences.

This project aims to address this problem by providing a Python-based password generator that creates strong, customizable, and criteria-validated passwords.

## 🎯 Scope of the Project
The scope of this project includes:

- Developing a Python program that generates strong passwords based on user-defined criteria.
- Allowing users to choose:
  - Minimum password length  
  - Whether to include numerical digits  
  - Whether to include special characters  
- Ensuring that the generated password meets all selected conditions.
- Providing an interactive user interface through the command line.
- Creating reusable functions such as password length checking.

This project focuses specifically on password generation and does **not** include password storage, encryption, or user account integration.
